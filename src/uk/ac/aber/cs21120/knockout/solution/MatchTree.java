/**
 * Written by evm18 - Eva Martens based on the IMatchTree Interface provided by James Finnis
 *
 *     A comment on the design for Task 4
 *
 *     Source for design idea https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV10FTdXnLg, "Google Coding Interview Question" deepest node
 *     The second solution in the video suggests comparing all nodes by level. I have adapted this to return a list of all matches from the tree.
 *     The current algorithm can be improved several ways:
 *     1) I could use extra space to track matches of each level by making a queue or stack of next matches in the match tree and storing the solution
 *        as an attribute of the tree. This would mean a huge reduction in operations, as checkNodes would only need to be called each time the
 *        stack of next matches hits 0. This would make the runtimemultiplication for checkNode() at worst linear, as we are only searching each node once to add
 *        to the stack. This comes closer to the solution suggested in the video source above.
 *     2) I could use the level attribute of the Nodes to itteratively only fetch the nodes of that level and then either store them
 *        on a stack (linear time, extra space) or check all the Nodes of the current level each time checkNode() is called (which results
 *        in âˆ‘ (n, 1) but saves space)
 *     The current algorithm of getNextMatch() and checkNode() results in extra space of half n and n log(n) tree searches and
 *     at most 1/2 n  comparisons against all other possible matches at any one time.
